Turns out dynamic lighting is pretty hard.  
Current idea:
- As the player walks, constantly replace the blocks beneath him with a "copy" that has lighting level set to 15.
- The copy has dynamic textures based on [TheGreyGhost's CamouflageBlock](https://github.com/TheGreyGhost/MinecraftByExample/tree/1-12-2-final/src/main/java/minecraftbyexample/mbe04_block_dynamic_block_model1).

#### Dynamic Lighting Roadmap
- [x] Working CamouflageBlock code.  
- [ ] Modify CamouflageBlock so we can specify which block it will copy.  
- [ ] Auto replace block below player wearing torch helmet.
